# arcane

Arcana is my WIP programming language.

## Todo
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] AST
- [x] Type checker

## Current design goals
- Interpreted
- Statically typed
- Procedural
- High-level syntax
- Everything is an expression
- Paramater types
- Enum variant types
- Type arithmetic
- No null
- Rich pattern matching

## Syntax
- Structs, rust-like enums, and literal unions
- Named bit flags
- Top-level Functions
- Rust-like impl blocks
- Traits
- Generics
- Closures
- Namespaces
- Type aliases
